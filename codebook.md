# Codebook for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Projekt: Tidy Dataset

## Data Source

The data sets used for this project are available under this download link: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The data sets published have been collected via waist-mounted smartphones with embedded inertial sensors. 
The goal was to analyse and to learn about human activities.

The data sets are distributed over several folders:

UCI HAR Dataset
  * activity_labels.txt (Information about the 6 used activities - used as clear names for the different activities within the later tidy data)
  * features.txt (the different variables that have been calculated - used as column names within the later tidy data)
    * test (folder with records concerning the test subjects)
      * subject_test.txt (the subject codes corresponding to every line of data within X_test.txt)
      * y_test.txt (the codes for activities corresponding to every line of data within X_test.txt)
      * X_test.txt (the collected values for the different features)
    * train (folder with records concerning train subjects)
      * subject_train.txt (see test data above)
      * y_train.txt (see test data above)
      * X_train.txt (see test data above)

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
